# QnA 

Please include a short write-up based on the following questions:

- How long did you spend on each aspect (initial idea, writing code, fixing bugs)?
  I spent about 16 hours total on the project: an hour writing the skeleton for the HTML page, nine hours crafting the idea and writing the associated CSS (I enjoy designing and coding simultaneously), five hours polishing the look and feel of the page, and one extra hour gathering and placing the images.

- If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
  I would tell myself to remember to clear my cache! There was a frustrating hour or so during which I couldn't figure out why my media query styles weren't showing up. Eventually I did a hard refresh, and that resolved the issue.

- What part was the most difficult part? A bug? Caught up on syntax?
  There was the caching problem (see my answer to the previous question). My computer has also been experiencing difficulties connecting to the Internet at the place where I'm staying. This made it challenging to fine-tune the page because so much of it depends on external resources (Google Fonts for the main typeface, FontAwesome for the icons, jQuery for toggling the sidebar menus).

- Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
  In terms of web design, yes.

- Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that weren't demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
  I'm capable of building data visualizations in D3 and writing modular JavaScript with MV* frameworks (AngularJS, Backbone.js, React).
