# HouseCall

### The Assignment

We have designed a desktop wireframe for a hypothetical web app named "HouseCall". HouseCall is an on-demand service provider that connects skilled workers in various sectors with the customers that need them. The app provides a showcase of the types of services offered as well as helps customers easily book these services.

### The Task

The task is to design a brand language for the app and showcase it as a responsive web prototype. Try not to spend more than 10-15 hours on this. You can create other pages and interactions, but we only expect a single landing page.

Use any technologies you feel comfortable with but please include any useful documentation that you would like us to see in your submission. The one only thing we ask from you is to _not use a CSS framework_.

Finally, once you have completed the assignment, please take some time to fill out the [QnA.md file attached](QnA.md).

Let us know if you need to extend the deadline, guidance, or support. Thank you again for your time and continued interest with Axiom Zen. We look forward to what you will create!
